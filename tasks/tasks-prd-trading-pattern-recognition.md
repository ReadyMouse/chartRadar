### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `chartradar/ingestion/base.py` and `tests/test_ingestion/test_base.py`).
- Use `pytest` to run tests. Running `pytest` without arguments executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Follow Python package structure conventions with `chartradar/` as the main package directory.
- All modules should have `__init__.py` files for proper package structure.
